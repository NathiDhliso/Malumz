# OFFICIAL WEBSITE PLAN: www.malumz.co.za
**Last Updated:** February 2026
**Strategy:** The book is the constitution. The website is the living infrastructure.

**The Dog Trainer** is a memoir and framework by Nkosinathi Dhliso. It tells the story of growing up across seven schools in post-apartheid South Africa and discovering that his father had been running a six-part training programme his entire life. The book formalizes this into the **Six Trainers** framework and proposes **Brotherhood Circles**, a community-based model where 20 men meet weekly for 6 months to rebuild themselves across all six dimensions.

The website serves three audiences: men who want to start a Circle, men who need crisis help now, and researchers or partners who want to verify the model.

## 5b. EXPANDED SYSTEM GUIDES (/systems)
**Purpose:** The book gives each system's core action steps. The website hosts the full expanded guides with detailed breakdowns, adaptations, practice scenarios, and examples.

**Why this exists:** The book was trimmed for cognitive load. A reader picks up the book, sees the action steps, and executes. When they want deeper context, worked examples, or adaptations for their specific situation, they come here.

**Content source:** All expanded content was removed from the print/ebook appendices during the February 2026 trim. The original detailed versions are preserved in the git history of the manuscript repository and should be migrated to the website CMS during build.

**URL pattern:** www.malumz.co.za/systems/[system-slug]
**Book cross-reference:** Each system in Appendix B includes its time commitment. The website URL is referenced globally via the note: "Every exercise can be done via voice note. For expanded guides, visit malumz.co.za/systems."

- **Contact:** nkosinathi.dhliso@gmail.com
- **Social Links:** As applicable

## 9. THE VISION (/vision)
**Purpose:** The formal infrastructure, Malumz Network, and policy recommendations — moved from the book (Appendix C Parts 2-4) to the website where they can be updated as things change.

**Why this exists:** The book is about what YOU can do. The vision pages are for the people building what comes next — funders, government, corporate partners, and future Malumz Network guides. They don't belong in a man's hands at 2 AM when he's trying to save his family. They belong here, where they can be found by the people who need them.

### 9a. FORMAL INFRASTRUCTURE VISION (/vision/infrastructure)

**None of this exists yet. It is conditional on Phase 1 success.**

If the pilot meets its targets (70%+ completion, 50%+ relationship improvement, 30%+ want to lead, ZERO weaponisation), we build:

- Paid facilitators and social workers
- Brotherhood Hotline (24/7 sanity preservation line)
- Refuge Rooms (physical spaces for men to decompress)
- Crisis Fund (emergency accommodation, transport, food vouchers)
- Formal Malumz certification

If the pilot fails those targets, we revise or scrap the model.

**Phase 2 (2030-2032):** 10 Centres. 500 graduates.
**Phase 3 (2032+):** Provincial rollout.

Live budget calculations, staffing models, and funding channels will be published here as they are developed.

### 9b. THE MALUMZ NETWORK (/vision/malumz-network)

Verified community guides who provide mentorship outside formal Circle sessions. 5-15 minute guidance in public spaces.

**Requirements:**
- Completed 6-month Circle programme
- **General Malumz:** 51/60+ score, qualified in all domains
- **Specialist Malumz:** 9/10+ in one domain, supervised monthly by a General Malumz
- Police clearance certificate (non-negotiable)
- Wears official Malumz t-shirt during community hours

**Anti-Predator Protocols:**

1. **Background Checks:** Police clearance, no sexual offence record, 3 community references. While waiting for SAPS clearance, operate ONLY with a fully cleared Malumz present.
2. **Visibility Rule:** Public spaces ONLY. Never private homes, cars, or isolated locations. If it rains or gets dark, session cancelled.
3. **10-Minute Rule:** Sessions are 5-15 minutes. Longer = refer to Circle or parents. Never take a boy somewhere private.
4. **Two-Adult Rule:** Any interaction over 10 minutes requires two Malumz or a parent present.
5. **Mandatory Reporting:** Suspected abuse must be reported to Social Development or SAPS immediately. "Protecting the brotherhood" never overrides protecting a child.

### 9c. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS (/vision/policy)

#### For Government

**1. Re-evaluate the "Life Orientation" Curriculum**
   *Context:* Current LO is often treated as a filler subject. It needs to become the headquarters for holistic development.
-   **Recommendation:** Revise LO to include rigorous modules on Financial Literacy (how interest works, taxes, debt) and Emotional Intelligence (conflict resolution, mental health).

**2. The "Missing Middle" Funding Model**
   *Context:* NSFAS serves the poor. Banks serve the rich. The middle collapses.
-   **Recommendation:** State-backed surety for student loans to the "Missing Middle" (family income R350k - R600k; 2026 figures. Check current NSFAS thresholds at nsfas.org.za), contingent on academic performance.

**3. Teacher Support, Not Just Assessment**
   *Context:* Teachers are overwhelmed.
-   **Recommendation:** Fund "Admin Assistants" for schools to handle paperwork so teachers can teach. Invest in psycho-social support for teachers dealing with traumatised classrooms.

#### For Corporate South Africa

**1. Rethink "Culture Fit"**
   *Context:* "Culture Fit" is often a mask for "Assimilation."
-   **Recommendation:** Adopt "Culture Add" hiring. Ask: "What does this person bring that we *don't* have?" rather than "Do they fit what we *do* have?"

**2. The Sponsorship vs Mentorship Shift**
   *Context:* Mentorship is giving advice. Sponsorship is opening doors.
-   **Recommendation:** Executives should have KPIs tied to the *promotion* of their mentees, not just the *meeting* with them.

**3. Fund the "Soft" Infrastructure**
   *Context:* Companies love building classrooms (physical). They rarely fund the development (social).
-   **Recommendation:** Shift CSI spend from brick-and-mortar to human capital programmes like the Brotherhood Circles. A classroom without a developed teacher is just a room.

#### Why This Approach May Face Resistance

1. **Political:** Requires admitting BEE alone isn't enough
2. **Ideological:** Some will call it "patriarchy". But it demands men SERVE, not dominate
3. **Economic:** Elite benefit from masses staying undeveloped
4. **Cultural:** Sounds like "traditional gender roles". But with accountability
5. **Personal:** Some men resist the process because accountability feels like attack
